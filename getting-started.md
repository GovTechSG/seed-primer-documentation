## Step 0: Ensure to complete all the prerequisites

- You need an active [TechPass account](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/onboard-to-techpass).
- Request for SEED provisioning. Refer to [SEED user documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/prerequisites-for-onboarding) to know how to request for SEED provisioning and for the complete list of SEED prerequisites.

## Step 1: Identify your onboarding persona

Find if your onboarding persona is **Vendor** or **Public officer**. Your onboarding persona depends on your TechPass login ID.

### Vendor 

If your TechPass login ID belongs to domain **techpass.gov.sg**, you need to onboard your Internet Device to SEED as a vendor. 

For example: If your TechPass login ID is john_doe@techpass.gov.sg, you need to onboard as vendor.

### Public officer

If your TechPass login ID is same as your organisational email address (WOG account), you need to onboard your Internet Device to SEED as a public officer. 

For example: If your TechPass login ID is john_doe@moe.gov.sg or john_doe_from.cognizant@tech.gov.sg, you need to onboard as vendor.

## Step 2: Onboard device to SEED

Refer to [SEED Documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/onboard-device/onboard-device-to-seed) for the step-by-step instructions for your onboarding persona.
