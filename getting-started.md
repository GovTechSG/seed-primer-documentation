## Step 0: Ensure you meet the following prerequisites

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: -3px;">
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">You need an active <a href="https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/onboard-to-techpass">TechPass account</a>.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">Request SEED provisioning. </li>
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">Internet Device running on one of the following operating systems:</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:-20px">Windows 10 and 11 Pro or Enterprise versions.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:-20px">macOS 11 (macOS Big Sur), macOS 12 (macOS Monterey) and macOS 13 (Ventura) versions.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">Have administrator permissions on the device.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">Remove any existing software on your device such as MDM software, Tanium client or any other unified endpoint management and security platform.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">Ensure that System Integrity Protection(SIP) is enabled if you are onboarding a macOS device.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">Encrypt hard disk drive to protect the data at rest.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:-20px">If your organisation uses a firewall or other policies to restrict Internet traffic, you may need to make few changes to allow WARP to connect.</li>  

?> Refer to the [SEED user documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/prerequisites-for-onboarding) to know how to ensure you meet the prerequisites.

## Step 1: Identify your onboarding persona

To determine if your onboarding persona is that of a **vendor** or a **public officer**, you can refer to your TechPass login ID. The onboarding persona is determined based on your login ID associated with TechPass.

| Onboarding Persona 	| Description 	| Example 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Vendor 	| If your TechPass login ID belongs to the domain ```techpass.gov.sg```, you need to onboard your Internet Device to SEED as a vendor. 	| john_doe@techpass.gov.sg 	|
| Public officer 	| If your TechPass login ID is the same as your organisational email address (WOG account), you need to onboard your Internet Device to SEED as a public officer. 	| john_doe@moe.gov.sg<br>john_doe_from.cognizant@tech.gov.sg 	|

## Step 2: Onboard device to SEED

Refer to the [SEED Documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/onboard-device/onboard-device-to-seed) for the step-by-step instructions for your onboarding persona.
