 ```mermaid

```

```mermaid
graph LR;
A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round);
B --> C{Decision};
C -->|One| D[Result 1];
C -->|Two| E[Result 2];
```

```mermaid
graph LR;
A[Hard] --\>|Text| B(Round)
B --\> C{Decision}
C --\>|One| D[Result 1]
C --\>|Two| E[Result 2]
```


This will generate a flowchart diagram with four nodes labeled "Hard," "Round," "Decision," "Result 1," and "Result 2," where "Hard" is connected to "Round" with a "Text" label, "Round" is connected to "Decision," "Decision" is connected to "Result 1" with a "One" label, and "Decision" is connected to "Result 2" with a "Two" label.
