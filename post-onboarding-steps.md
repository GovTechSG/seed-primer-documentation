# Post onboarding steps

After completing the SEED onboarding process, please proceed with the [post-onboarding steps](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/post-onboarding-instructions/post-onboarding-steps-and-verification) for your operating system. 

The objective of this is to ensure the following:

- Enable Full Disk Access(FDA) for SEED components.
- Activate Cloudflare WARP on the device.

When you complete the post onboarding steps, it ensures that SEED functions properly and that Cloudflare WARP is activated on your device, enhancing the security and performance of your device.
