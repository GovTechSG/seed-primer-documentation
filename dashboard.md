# DEEP Dashboard

Development Environment Endpoint Posture(DEEP) is a robust security system that relies on data and functionality from various SEED components such as: TechPass, Cloudflare, Defender, and Microsoft Intune. Its primary objective is to detect potentially insecure devices and prevent them from accessing SEED-protected resources. DEEP also ensures device compliance by measuring configurations against CIS-based benchmarks and automatically correcting non-compliant settings whenever possible.

The user-facing component of DEEP is known as the DEEP Dashboard. This intuitive dashboard empowers SEED users with the following capabilities:

- View device details such as serial numbers and OS platforms of their device onboarded to SEED.

- Detect potentially malicious activity by leveraging on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. 

- Identify non-compliant device configurations by comparing settings against CIS-based benchmarks and automates corrective actions for optimal security.
